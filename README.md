# 📌 git

Git is a version control system available on every developer’s computer. It allows easy branching and merging. At the same time GitHub makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration 🤝

I am happy to share some git commands that I used to create my GitHub portfolio.
